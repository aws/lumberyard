-- When you see an option that does not have a platform preceeding it, that is the default
-- value for anything not specificly set per platform. So if remote_filesystem=0 and you have
-- ios_remote_file_system=1 then remote filesystem will be off for all platforms except ios
-- Any of the settings in this file can be prefixed with a platform name:
-- android, ios, osx, linux, windows, appletv, etc...
-- or left unprefixed, to set all platforms not specified. The rules apply in the order they're declared

-- remote_filesystem - enable Virtual File System (VFS)

-- on the asset processor computers cache instead of deploying them the remote device

-- What type of assets are we going to load?
-- We need to know this before we establish VFS because different platform assets
-- are stored in different root folders in the cache.  These correspond to the names
-- In the asset processor config file.  This value also controls what config file is read
-- when you read system_xxxx_xxxx.cfg (for example, system_windows_pc.cfg or system_android_es3.cfg)
-- by default, pc assets (in the 'pc' folder) are used, with RC being fed 'pc' as the platform
-- by default on console we use the default assets=pc for better iteration times
-- we should turn on console specifc assets only when in release and/or testing assets and/or loading performance

-- Example: 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.15
