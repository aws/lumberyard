markers = unit: Tiny, fast, heavily isolated tests that target Python tools. Similar to compiler and linker errors, failures here block the build pipeline extremely fast.
          bvt: The Build Verification Test 'BVT' suite is the set of critical-priority integration "smoke" or "sanity" tests. Similar to unit tests, failures block builds quickly.
          integ: Integration tests walk across multiple modules focusing on API contracts and I/O, but do not test entire user workflows across the product. Failures here block releasing a package, and inform manual testing.
          system: High-level tests which exercise entire user workflows across a large swath of the product. This includes tests that verify the interaction between multiple tools and modules, complex gameplay scenarios, or User Interfaces. Failures here inform where a lower-level test case should be created.
          perf: Performance-sensitive tests which should only be run on the same, specific machine.  The purpose of these "tests" is to exercise code and log metrics, so they tend to not have an objective pass/fail state.
          unstable: Tests known to intermittently fail or are otherwise not ready.  These tests are not "skipped" and still be run and report, but will not contribute to stability or coverage metrics.
