    // from outside, CNodeLiveWriterRef is the class that is always used to access a node. CNodeLiveWriter is never used directly from outside.
    // The main reason for this is because the live nodes are reusable: It could be possible to keep a "valid" pointer to a livenode even after the original node has been discarded and another one has taken its place.
    // That situation is avoided with the use of this wrapper reference and the safecheckID. Every time a livenode is reused, its safecheckID changes. If the safecheckID of
    //   the CNodeLiveWriterRef does not match the one in the LiveNode, then it can not be used.

    // Note: this object is slightly different than the CNodeLiveReaderRef used in the reader. the reader one does not need the safecheckID because the life of a LiveNodeReader
    //       is directly determined by how many references are active. When no references are active, the LiveNodeReader is discarded. In the case of the writer we can not do
    //       that because livenodes can ( and have to ) be moved into the main data buffer only at the right time, independently of what is the external use of them.

    // - novalid -> right after being compacted, the object is flaged as "novalid" so it can be reused for the next "LiveNode".
