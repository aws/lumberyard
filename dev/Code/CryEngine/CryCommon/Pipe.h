// Description : Queue class that can be used to send data from a single
//               writer thread to a single reader thread efficiently.

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Pipe
    //
    // This class is a templated, dynamically-resizing, lock-free queue class
    // that can be used to convey data from a single writer thread to a single
    // reader thread. It does *NOT* handle the case where there are multiple
    // readers or writers. It is designed for maximum efficiency in its
    // intended use-case.
    //
    // It differs from standard lock-free queue implementations in that it
    // uses a circular buffer approach, rather than a linked-list approach.
    // This is more memory efficient, and also should be more efficient in
    // time in all cases.
    //
    // In addition there is zero contention overhead. A normal lock-free
    // implementation makes use of atomic primitives such as Compare and Swap
    // (CAS). The drawback of this is that if there is contention, the code
    // must loop until it successfully updates the variable, whereas the time
    // taken here is basically constant (in the equlibrium case where the
    // buffer has grown to a size that is large enough to handle all the data,
    // which should happen very quickly).
    //
    //
    // Usage Notes:
    //
    // The class implements the following members:
    //
    // Push(item) -          MUST ONLY BE CALLED FROM WRITER THREAD. Push a
    //                       single value onto the queue. Constant complexity
    //                       in equilibrium case.
    //
    // bool Pop(item) -      MUST ONLY BE CALLED FROM READER THREAD. Retrieve
    //                       the next value from the queue. The return value
    //                       indicates whether there was anything to retrieve.
    //                       Constant complexity in equilibrium case.
    //
    // Clear() -             MUST ONLY BE CALLED FROM WRITER THREAD. Remove all
    //                       items from the queue. Constant complexity in
    //                       equilibrium case.
    //
    // Replace(item, repl) - MUST ONLY BE CALLED FROM WRITER THREAD. Replace
    //                       all occurrences of item with repl. Linear
    //                       complexity with respect to the size of the queue.
    //                       NOTE that this is *only* supported for data types
    //                       that can be written atomically - ints, pointers,
    //                       etc.
    //
    // Swap(other) -         MUST ONLY BE CALLED FROM WRITER THREAD. Replace
    //                       the contents of the queue with those of another
    //                       instance. This is *only* safe if the other queue
    //                       is not referred to by other threads!
    //
    //
    // Implementation Overview:
    //
    // The class basically contains a queue of queues. This is required to
    // support dynamic resizing. Each sub-queue is called a page. Values are
    // only ever pushed onto the last page - the earlier pages are simply kept
    // around until all items on them have been read, at which point they are
    // deleted.
    //
    // When the last page is full, a new page is allocated that is twice the
    // size of the last page. This means that eventually we will reach the
    // situation where we have a single page that is large enough to handle
    // the traffic in the current situation - in this situation performance is
    // optimal.
