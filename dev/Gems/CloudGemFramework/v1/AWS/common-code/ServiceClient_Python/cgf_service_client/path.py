class Path(object):
    """Provides an HTTP client optimized for use with REST style service APIs
    authenticated using AWS IAM credentials.

    Usage Examples:
      client = cgf_service_client.for_url('https://example.com/base')

      # GET https://example.com/base
      content = client.GET() # content = { 'Greeting': 'Hello World' }

      # GET http://example.com/base/foo

        - or -
      content = client.navigate('foo').GET()

      # GET http://example.com/base/a/b/c/d
      content = client.navigate('a', 'b', 'c', 'd').GET()

      # GET http://example.com/base/http%3A%2F%2Fquoted
      content = client.navigate('http://quoted').GET()

      # GET http://example.com/base?foo=10&bar=20
      content = client.GET(foo=10, bar=20)

      # POST http://example.com/base with JSON body
      result = client.POST({'foo': { 'bar': 10 } })

      body = cgf_service_client.Data()

      # POST http://example.com/base?foo=10&bar=20 with JSON body
      result = client.POST({'foo': 'bar'}, foo=10, bar=20)

      # PUT http://example.com/base with JSON body
      result = client.PUT({'foo': 'bar'})

    Error Handling:
      HTTP status codes in the range 200-299 will cause the request method (GET,
      PUT, etc.) to return the response content normally. Any other status code
      will result in one of the following exceptions being thrown.

          HttpError
            ClientError            400-499
              NotAllowedError      401, 403

        # data.
        #
        # Such data isn't that useful in production environments but can be invaluable
        # during development. For example, the Path object could populate itself with
        # attributes representing the expected paths, and delete the attributes 
        # representing unsupported operations. This would allow you to use a REPL 
        # prompt to easily explore an api.
        #
        # It could also be used to validate request and response data, which helps 
        # detect and isolate issues early in development. However, this verification
        # usually isn't worth the overhead in production, after everything is working. 
        # 
        # A spec for an api would look something like the following. It is basically

        # the spec without worrying about loosing track of type definitions. In practice
        # the same object would be referenced from multiple locations the in spec, so
        # there isn't a lot of memory being used.
        #
        # Some special handling of '..' would be needed if you want spec data to flow up
        # the path. Currently we don't keep track of the parent of the path, meaning:
        #  
        #    assertFalse( foo.bar.APPLY('..') is foo )

        #    assertEquals(foo.CONFIG.A, 1)
        #    bar = foo.APPLY('bar', A = 2)
