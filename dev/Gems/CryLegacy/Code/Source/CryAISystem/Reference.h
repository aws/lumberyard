// Description : References to AI objects

// Notes: this-> is used when referring to members to compile on GCC - due to specialization rules compiler
//        cannot assume any inherited members exist in a templated base (Meyer, Item 43, Effective C++)


/**
 * References to AI objects.
 *
 * (More accurately: smartpointers)
 * These references can be preserved across frames and dereferenced to give an AIStub * or AIObject *, which should
 * always be discarded between frames.
 * There are four main types:
 * tAIObjectID -  A simple integer ID. This is the only type that should pass outside the AI system.
 * WeakRef -      Wraps an ID with templated type. For use within the AI system.
 * StrongRef -    Wraps an ID with templated type and auto_ptr semantics. Uniquely owns the object, controlling its validity. Within AI.
 * CountedRef -   Wraps a StrongRef for reference-counting semantics. Within AI.
 *
 * Notes:
 * Strong should be preferred but are not compatible (and will not compile) with STL containers. Counted can be used in this case.
 * Counted is rather bolted on and should be properly integrated!
